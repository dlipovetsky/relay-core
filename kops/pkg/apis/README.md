This is a partial import of kops. This is needed for the types that are generated
without including the entire module. The types are versioned and updates will be trivial
to pull in.

There are some things on the kops roadmap to make this stuff easier and there's a couple
pull requests open that will help make kops more modular and feel more like a library.
